   abstract = {We study gravity drainage using a new 1-D, multiphase sea ice model. A parametrization of gravity drainage based on the convective nature of gravity drainage is introduced, whose free parameters are determined by optimizing model output against laboratory measurements of sea ice salinity evolution. Optimal estimates of the free parameters as well as the parametrization performance remain stable for vertical grid resolutions from 1 to 30 mm. We find a strong link between sea ice growth rate and bulk salinity for constant boundary conditions but only a weak link for more realistic boundary conditions. We also demonstrate that surface warming can trigger brine convection over the whole ice layer. Over a growth season, replacing the convective parametrization with constant initial salinities leads to an overall 3% discrepancy of stored energy, thermal resistance, and salt release. We also derive from our convective parametrization a simplified, numerically cheap and stable gravity-drainage parametrization. This parametrization results in an approximately 1% discrepancy of stored energy, thermal resistance, and salt release compared to the convective parametrization. A similarly low discrepancy to our complex parametrization can be reached by simply prescribing a depth-dependent salinity profile. ©2013. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.},

   abstract = {The understanding of sea ice mass balance processes requires continuous monitoring of the seasonal evolution of the ice thickness. While autonomous ice mass balance (IMB) buoys deployed over the past two decades have contributed to scientists' understanding of ice growth and decay processes, deployment has been limited, in part, by the cost of such systems. Routine, basinwide monitoring of the ice cover is realistically achievable through a network of reliable and affordable autonomous instrumentation. This paper describes the development of a novel autonomous platform and sensor that replaces the traditional thermistor strings formonitoring temperature profiles in the ice and snow using a chain of inexpensive digital temperature chip sensors linked by a single-wire data bus. By incorporating a heating element into each sensor, the instrument is capable of resolving material interfaces (e.g., air-snow and ice-ocean boundaries) even under isothermal conditions. The instrument is small, low cost, and easy to deploy. Field and laboratory tests of the sensor chain demonstrate that the technology can reliably resolve material boundaries to within a few centimeters. The discrimination between different media based on sensor thermal response is weak in some deployments and efforts to optimize the performance continue ©by Teachers College, Columbia University.},

To do so, we first explore how sea-ice surface melt and flooding can be incorporated into the 1-D thermodynamic Semi-Adaptive Multi-phase Sea-Ice Model (SAMSIM) presented by Griewank and Notz (2013). We introduce flooding and a flushing parametrization which treats sea ice as a hydraulic network of horizontal and vertical fluxes. Forcing SAMSIM with 36 years of ERA-interim atmospheric reanalysis data, we obtain a modelled Arctic sea-ice salinity that agrees well with ice-core measurements. The simulations thus allow us to identify the main drivers of the observed mean salinity profile in Arctic sea ice. Our results show a 1.5-4 g kgg'1 decrease of bulk salinity via gravity drainage after ice growth has ceased and before flushing sets in, which hinders approximating bulk salinity from ice thickness beyond the first growth season. In our simulations, salinity interannual variability of first-year ice is mostly restricted to the top 20 cm. We find that ice thickness, thermal resistivity, freshwater column, and stored energy change by less than 5% on average when the full salinity parametrization is replaced with a prescribed salinity profile.},

However, sea ice temperature profiles measured by ice-tethered buoys are rarely used to infer snow depth and sea ice thickness owing to the lack of automatic discrimination algorithms, restricting the use of the data for sea ice thermodynamics studies. In this study, snow depth and sea ice thickness were retrieved through the measurements of sea ice temperature profiles using discrimination algorithms of the change point and the maximum likelihood detection methods. The data measured by 50 ice-tethered buoys were used to evaluate the accuracy of the results determined by the algorithm. Influences on the seasonal sea ice thermodynamic state, vertical interval of temperature sensors on the buoys, and initial ice thickness on the estimation errors were also evaluated. The performance of the discrimination algorithm for the data from the Arctic and Antarctic regions was also compared. There were no identifiable differences between the estimation errors from the Arctic and Antarctica. Increases in both the interval of the temperature sensors and the initial ice thickness enlarged the error for the estimation of ice thickness. A procedure developed in this study strengthens the potential application of measurements from the ice-tethered buoys only with the measurements of the vertical temperature profile of the layer of snow-covered ice, but not the measurements of ice basal and surface positions using acoustic sounding.},

We analyzed data from 23 sea ice mass balance buoys (IMBs) deployed during the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) expedition in 2019–2020 to investigate the seasonality and timing of sea ice thermodynamic mass balance in the Arctic Transpolar Drift. The data reveal four stages of the ice season: (I) onset of ice basal freezing, mid-October to November; (II) rapid ice growth, December–March; (III) slow ice growth, April–May; and (IV) melting, June onward. Ice basal growth ranged from 0.64 to 1.38 m at a rate of 0.004–0.006 m d–1, depending mainly on initial ice thickness. Compared to a buoy deployed close to the MOSAiC setup site in September 2012, total ice growth was about twice as high, due to the relatively thin initial ice thickness at the MOSAiC sites. Ice growth from the top, caused by surface flooding and subsequent snow-ice formation, was observed at two sites and likely linked to dynamic processes. Snow reached a maximum depth of 0.25 ± 0.08 m by May 2, 2020, and had melted completely by June 25, 2020. The relatively early onset of ice basal melt on June 7 (±10 d), 2019, can be partly attributed to the unusually rapid advection of the MOSAiC floes towards Fram Strait. The oceanic heat flux, calculated based on the heat balance at the ice bottom, was 2.8 ± 1.1 W m–2 in December–April, and increased gradually from May onward, reaching 10.0 ± 2.6 W m–2 by mid-June 2020. Subsequently, under-ice melt ponds formed at most sites in connection with increasing ice permeability. Our analysis provides crucial information on the Arctic sea ice mass balance for future studies related to MOSAiC and beyond.},

This study investigates: if thickness results from temperature recorded by SIMS of different designs, and analysed with different methods are comparable; which methods are recommended for their robustness, precision and accuracy and how they compare to independent thickness measurements; how otherwise unuseable data can be salvaged through specific SIMS designs. We present an analysis of fast-ice thickness calculated from SIMS deployed in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica and in the Chukchi Sea near Utqiaġvik, Alaska, over two decades. We find that median thicknesses derived by different methods agree within 1 ± 1.5 cm for McMurdo Sound and 2 ± 3 cm for Utqiaġvik. Thus, it is possible to confidently compare data collected from different stations and analysed with different methods.

Here we perform a set of idealised experiments which model sea ice growth under a range of ambient salinities, freezing temperatures, and freezing orientations. The results confirm existing theories; sea ice growth rate is largest for cooler freezing temperatures, fresher ambient salinities, and bottom oriented freezing configuration. Our primary metric of interest is the brine mass fraction (the mass ratio of brine inclusions to the total sea ice), which we quantify and determine the sensitivity of with respect to changes in freezing conditions. We find that the brine mass fraction of our model sea ice is most sensitive to freezing temperature, and increases 2.5% per 1 • C increase of freezing temperature. This finding suggests that future sea ice in warmer climate states will retain more brine, with subsequent flow on effects for circulations driven by brine rejection in the high-latitude oceans.},

   abstract = {Sea ice has a non-zero salinity that varies in space and time. This affects the sea ice thermal properties as well as the ice-ocean salt and freshwater exchanges, which may influence the sea ice mass balance and the polar oceans' characteristics. However, current sea ice models neglect or misrepresent the ice salinity. In this paper, we address the question of the importance of large-scale sea ice salinity variations for the sea ice mass balance and the upper ocean. To examine this question, we formulate salinity variations in the framework of the sea ice thickness distribution theory, using a simple parameterization for brine entrapment and drainage. The latter is tested one-dimensionally and then included in a three-dimensional large-scale ice-ocean model, OPA9-LIM3, which is run over 1970-2006, forced by a combination of atmospheric reanalyses and climatologies. Due to differences in the physical forcings, the model simulates Arctic and Antarctic sea ice salinity fields that profoundly differ, with a seasonal cycle that is found in reasonable agreement with available ice core data. Then, the role of salinity variations is analyzed by comparing the results of the simulation including the interactive salinity with several sensitivity runs using simpler representations of ice salinity. The simulated large-scale sea ice mass balance and upper ocean characteristics are found to be quite sensitive to the representation of ice salinity. In the Arctic, salinity variations induce changes in ice thickness up to one meter in some regions, due to modifications in the sea ice thermal properties. Around Antarctica, including salinity variations increases the simulated winter sea ice volume by up to 28% because of changes in ice-ocean interactions that stabilize the ocean. The model sensitivity to the sea ice salinity is of the same order of magnitude as a 10% change in bare ice albedo. Given the importance of salinity on the simulated sea ice characteristics, sea ice salinity variations should be included in assessments of the response of the high-latitude oceans to ongoing and future climate change. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Results show that the inclusion of such a parameterization leads to an increase and thickening of sea ice in the Eurasian Arctic and within the ice pack in the Antarctic circumpolar region, and a weakening of the North Atlantic Deep Water and a strengthening of the Antarctic Bottom Water.

Sensitivity of sea ice and ocean simulations to sea ice salinity in a coupled global climate model. Sea ice is an important component of the climate system and an early indictor of climate change [1-3]. Sea ice acts as an insulating layer, moderating exchanges of heat, moisture , momentum, and CO 2 between the atmosphere and the ocean at high-latitudes. Sea ice interacts with the broader climate system through the positive ice albedo-temperature feedback, which amplifies the projected warming at high-latitudes, and through the ocean buoyancy feedback involving the growth and melt of sea ice, which influences the global thermohaline circulation (i.e., the North Atlantic Deep Water and the Antarctic Bottom Water). The implementation of a sea ice component that accurately simulates sea ice mass balance, interfacial fluxes, and associated feedbacks with the atmosphere and the ocean into coupled global climate models (CGCMs) has received considerable attention in the global climate modeling community for the past decade. One factor motivating such improvement is the enhanced climate sensitivity at high-latitudes, particularly in the Arctic [2, 3]. Another factor is the increasing observational evidence of remarkable changes in various aspects of polar climate (i.e., the dramatic decrease of the Arctic sea ice cover and thickness [4, 5]), which requires mechanistic understanding and appropriate representation in climate simulations. Observations suggest that the presence of salinity in sea ice has a substantial influence on the physical, thermody-namic, and mechanical properties of sea ice (i.e., associated with temperature, the ice salinity determines the brine-solid ice phase equilibrium [6]), and ocean buoyancy (i.e., associated with the growth and melt of sea ice, the salt flux influences the oceanic density stratification and deep water formation [7]). The salinity of sea ice evolves as follows. Brine pockets are entrapped initially in sea ice during the growth process. The amount of salt entrapped increases with the salinity of},

An imaging system, capable of resolving inclusion sizes of less than 0.01 mm in diameter, was used to examine the microstructure of first-year ice in a temperature-controlled laboratory. Experiments were initially carried out at -15°C to obtain size distributions for brine inclusions and gas bubbles in cold ice. Brine inclusion dimensions were found to range from less than 0.01 mm to nearly 10 mm, with number densities averaging about 24 pockets per mm3. This is an order of magnitude larger than number densities previously reported. Gas bubbles in the samples were generally smaller than 0.2 mm and had number densities of approximately 1 per mm3, also an order of magnitude larger than previously reported. Large changes in microstructure were observed as samples were cooled to -30°C and subsequently warmed to -2°C. Observational results document the thermal evolution of the ice, as well as interactions between brine inclusions, gas bubbles, and precipitated salts. The link between the structural and optical properties of sea ice is closely tied to the total cross-sectional area of the inclusions. We show that this quantity increases dramatically when the ice cools below -23°C or warms above -5°C, but because changes in brine inclusions offset changes in precipitated salts, it remains surprisingly constant between these temperatures.},

   abstract = {Pound for pound, sea ice is the most important component of Earth's climate system. The changing conditions in which sea ice forms and exists are likely to affect the properties of sea ice itself, and potential climate feedbacks need to be identified and understood to improve future projections. Here we perform a set of idealised experiments which model sea ice growth under a range of ambient salinities, freezing temperatures, and freezing orientations. The results confirm existing theories; sea ice growth rate is largest for cooler freezing temperatures, fresher ambient salinities, and bottom oriented freezing configuration. Our primary metric of interest is the brine mass fraction (the mass ratio of brine inclusions to the total sea ice), which we quantify and determine the sensitivity of with respect to changes in freezing conditions. We find that the brine mass fraction of our model sea ice is most sensitive to freezing temperature, and increases 2.5% per 1oC increase of freezing temperature. This finding suggests that future sea ice in warmer climate states will retain more brine, with subsequent flow on effects for circulations driven by brine rejection in the high-latitude oceans.},

   abstract = {Climate change is generating sufficient risk for nation-states and citizens throughout the Arctic to warrant potentially radical geoengineering solutions. Currently, geoengineering solutions such as surface albedo modification or aerosol deployment are in the early stages of testing and development. Due to the scale of deployments necessary to enact change, and their preliminary nature, these methods are likely to result in unforeseen consequences. These consequences may range in severity from local ecosystem impacts to large scale changes in available solar energy. The Arctic is an area that is experiencing rapid change, increased development, and exploratory interest, and proposed solutions have the potential to produce new risks to both natural and human systems. This article examines potential security and ethical considerations of geoengineering solutions in the Arctic from the perspectives of securitization, consequentialism, and risk governance approaches, and argues that proactive and preemptive frameworks at the international level, and especially the application of risk governance approaches, will be needed to prevent or limit negative consequences resulting from geoengineering efforts. Utilizing the unique structures already present in Arctic governance provides novel options for addressing these concerns from both the perspective of inclusive governance and through advancing the understanding of uncertainty analysis and precautionary principles.},

   abstract = {The contribution of brine layers to observed reflective anisotropy of sea ice at 100 MHz is quantitatively assessed. The sea ice is considered to be a stratified, inhomogeneous, anisotropic dielectric consisting of pure ice containing ordered arrays of conducting inclusions (brine layers). A theoretical explanation for observed reflective anisotropy is proposed in terms of anisotropic electric flux penetration into the brine layers. Penetration anisotropy and brine layer geometry are linked to anisotropy in the complex dielectric constant of sea ice. A numerical method of approximating the reflected power of a plane wave pulse incident on a slab of sea ice is presented. Mixture dielectric constants are calculated for two polarizations of the incident wave: the electric field parallel to the c-axis direction, and the electric field perpendicular to the c-axis direction. These dielectric constants are used to calculate power reflection coefficients for the two polarizations. 21 refs.},

   abstract = {MPI-ESM is a new version of the global Earth system model developed at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology. This paper describes the ocean state and circulation as well as basic aspects of variability in simulations contributing to the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). The performance of the ocean/sea-ice model MPIOM, coupled to a new version of the atmosphere model ECHAM6 and modules for land surface and ocean biogeochemistry, is assessed for two model versions with different grid resolution in the ocean. The low-resolution configuration has a nominal resolution of 1.5 <sup>°</sup>, whereas the higher resolution version features a quasiuniform, eddy-permitting global resolution of 0.4<sup>°</sup>. The paper focuses on important oceanic features, such as surface temperature and salinity, water mass distribution, large-scale circulation, and heat and freshwater transports. In general, these integral quantities are simulated well in comparison with observational estimates, and improvements in comparison with the predecessor system are documented; for example, for tropical variability and sea ice representation. Introducing an eddy-permitting grid configuration in the ocean leads to improvements, in particular, in the representation of interior water mass properties in the Atlantic and in the representation of important ocean currents, such as the Agulhas and Equatorial current systems. In general, however, there are more similarities than differences between the two grid configurations, and several shortcomings, known from earlier versions of the coupled model, prevail. © 2013.
